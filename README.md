## Overview
This project provides a tool to decipher text using a key-based approach. It is designed to extract specific letters from words in a given cipher text based on a set of keys, allowing you to find possible decryptions. This tool can be particularly useful for cryptographic analysis or linguistic research.

## Features
# Letter Extraction: 
Extracts letters from words in the cipher text based on a given key.
# Key Generation: 
Generates all possible keys up to a specified length and digit range.
# Decryption Analysis: 
Analyzes the cipher text with all possible keys to find meaningful decryptions.
# Customizable Parameters: 
Allows customization of array size, maximum key length, and maximum key digit.

## Output
i set a filter for keys based on a guess for original words.
This code will generate all possible decryptions of the given cipher text and print those that start with "شاید" and ends with "کجاست"(based on question mark at the end). The output will be limited to a maximum of 10,000 results.
