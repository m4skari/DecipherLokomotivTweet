## Overview
This project provides a tool to decipher text using a key-based approach. It is designed to extract specific letters from words in a given cipher text based on a set of keys, allowing you to find possible decryptions. This tool can be particularly useful for cryptographic analysis or linguistic research.

## Features
Letter Extraction: Extracts letters from words in the cipher text based on a given key.
Key Generation: Generates all possible keys up to a specified length and digit range.
Decryption Analysis: Analyzes the cipher text with all possible keys to find meaningful decryptions.
Customizable Parameters: Allows customization of array size, maximum key length, and maximum key digit.
